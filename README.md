# phone-tracker-desktop-side
Desktop app that tracks down the user's smartphone by fetching the coordinates saved into a Firebase DB

The coordinates are written into the Firebase DB via an Android app designed by one of my Uni colleagues

After fetching the location, the user can plot it using an in-app map widget, or through means of the in-browser Google Maps services

The coordinates are updated once every 2 minutes, as long as the Android app is running

GUI designed with Python's customTkinter module
